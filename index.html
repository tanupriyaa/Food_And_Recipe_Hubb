                        <p align="left">Firstly soak saffron in water to prepare saffron water (one tsp saffron can be soaked in 1/4 cup water).
                            Next, mix kewra drops in water and mix well to make kewra water. Set them aside for later usage.
                            Now, chop the onion and coriander leaves and keep them aside.
                            Heat olive oil in a deep bottomed pan. Once the oil is hot enough, add cumin seeds, bay leaf, green cardamom, black cardamom, cloves in it, and saute for about a minute. 
                            Then, add chopped onion to it and saute until pink. Now, add chicken into it with slit green chillies, turmeric, salt to taste, ginger-garlic paste, red chilli powder and green chilli paste. Mix well all the spices and cook for 2-3 minutes. Then, add hung curd into it and give a mix.
                            Turn the flame to medium again and add garam masala in it along with ginger julienned, coriander and mint leaves. Add kewra water, rose water and 1 tsp saffron water in it. Cook till the chicken is tender. Then add 1 cup cooked rice and spread evenly. Then add the remaining saffron water and pour ghee over it. You can now cook the dish without the lid or cover it with a lid to give a dum-effect due to the steam formation.
                            Cook for 15-20 minutes with a closed lid and garnish with 1 tbsp fried onions and coriander leaves. Serve hot chicken biryani with raita of your choice. Enjoy!

                        <h3>Tips</h3>
                        <p align="left">1. The first and foremost important thing to take care of while preparing chicken biryani recipe is, always use a heavy-bottomed pan as you would not want the chicken getting cooked.
                            <br>2. The restaurant-style chicken biryani recipe uses the whole chicken in preparation and the chicken can dry when cooking at home. Always use chicken thigh or drumsticks. <br>
                            3. If you want your chicken to be juicier in your biryani, do not remove the bone. <br>
                            4. If your cooked rice has turned sticky, spread it on a plate and leave it for 5 minutes. The rice will be separate and fluffy again.
                            <br>5. Freshly pound spices bring out the best taste in Chicken Biryani Recipe, so make sure that you dry roast all the whole spices for a good 2-3 minutes and then pound or grind them.</p>

                            <br>2 cups (200 gm) Flour
                            <br>600 gms Grated Paneer

                        <h3>Instructions</h3>
                        <p align="left"> Boil sugar and water to prepare syrup remove from fire. Add cardamom and keep aside to cool.
                            In a mixing bowl put the flour, paneer, sooji, Nestlé MILKMAID, baking powder and baking soda. Mix gently to make a soft dough. Do not knead too much.
                            Divide the mixture into 30-35 portions and gently roll into round gulab jamuns. Fry in the oil at very low flame till golden brown in color.
                            Keep putting the fried gulab jamuns in the prepared sugar syrup. Once all the gulab jamuns are in the sugar syrup bring it to a boil and remove from flame.
                            Serve warm
                            </p>
                        <h3>Tips</h3>
                        <p align="left">If the oil is not hot enough, jamuns will soak up lots of oil and turn soggy. They will also not hold the shape well and may form a crusty layer over the gulab jamuns later.
                            If the oil is too hot, the dough will get dispersed in the oil or the jamuns will get plenty of cracks or may get blistered. Also they will get browned quickly without cooking inside. There will be a hard center even after soaking since the dough has remained uncooked.
                            Once the oil is hot, regulate the flame to medium. Drop the balls one after the other slowly. Do not add a lot of them and crowd the pan as they need enough space to fry and become big while frying. Do not disturb them until they firm up and cook a bit.
                            Once you see the jamuns are turning firm, then reduce the flame to low and fry gently stirring them until evenly golden.

                        <h3>Tips</h3>
                        <p align="left"> Marination is the key to get flavorful, tender & succulent pieces of chicken.
                            Yogurt in the marinade tenderizes the chicken so do not skip it.
                            Makhani recipe never uses onion. However using them helps to balance the tang/sour taste of tomatoes, especially if you are using passata or canned tomatoes.                            
                            The rich taste in the gravy comes from the cashews (or almonds) & cream.                            
                            You can make the gravy ahead and refrigerate. Just grill the marinated chicken when needed and heat up the gravy. Then add the grilled chicken.</p>

                        <p class="meal-descript-about">In cuisine, an omelette is a dish made from beaten eggs, fried with butter or oil in a frying pan. It is quite common for the omelette to be folded around fillings such as chives, vegetables, mushrooms, meat, cheese, onions or some combination of the above.

                        <p><br>3 eggs, beaten
                            <br>1 tsp sunflower oil
                            <br>1 tsp butter
                        </p>
                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <p><br>1. Beat the eggs: Use two or three eggs per omelette, depending on how hungry you are. Beat the eggs lightly with a fork.
                            2. Melt the butter: Use an 8-inch nonstick skillet for a 2-egg omelette, a 9-inch skillet for 3 eggs. Melt the butter over medium-low heat, and keep the temperature low and slow when cooking the eggs so the bottom doesn’t get too brown or overcooked.
                            3. Add the eggs: Let the eggs sit for a minute, then use a heatproof silicone spatula to gently lift the cooked eggs from the edges of the pan. Tilt the pan to allow the uncooked eggs to flow to the edge of the pan.
                            4. Fill the omelette: Add the filling—but don’t overstuff the omelette—when the eggs begin to set. Cook for a few more seconds
                            5. Fold and serve: Fold the omelette in half. Slide it onto a plate with the help of a silicone spatula.

                        <h3>Instructions</h3>
                        <p align="left">Add the ice cream, milk, Nutella and 3 Ferrero Rocher balls to a blender.
                            Place the lid on the blender. Start on a low speed and gradually increase the speed until the milkshake is blended and creamy. If it is too thick you can add a bit more milk until you have the consistency you prefer.
                            Taste the milkshake and if you want more chocolate or hazelnut flavour you can add a bit more Nutella or another Ferrero Rocher ball.
                            Drizzle chocolate sauce on the inside of two tall glasses. Pour the milkshake into the glasses. Top with whipped cream, drizzle with chocolate sauce and top with a Ferrero Rocher ball.

                        <h3>Tips</h3>
                        <p>For thicker milkshake:
                            The thickness of the milkshake will be determined by how firm the ice cream is and how much milk is added. To make the milkshake thicker, make sure the ice cream is on the firmer side and add a small amount of milk at a time until you have the consistency you are looking for.
                        </p>

                            <br>¼ teaspoon Sugar

                            <br>1 tablespoon Oil
                            <br>Salt
                        </p>
                        <h3>Instructions</h3>
                        <p align="left">Golden roast firstly fenugreek seeds and cumin seeds in few drops of oil in a pan.
                            Powder it using hand mortar and pestle or you can simply crush it using a rolling pin.
                            Add 1 tablespoon oil in a pressure cooker, add ginger, garlic firstly. Followed by cubed onion.
                            Saute until translucent. Then add cubed tomato.
                            Fry them until the the tomatoes turn mushy.
                            Cool and grind.
                            Meanwhile, heat the pressure cooker with 2 tablespoon oil and temper with the items given under ‘to temper’ table.
                            Add the ground onion tomato and add the masala powder, turmeric. Fry till oil separates.
                            Fry covered as it will splutter a lot, in medium flame until it reduces in volume. Say 5-6 minutes.
                            Add green peas and enough water (1 & ½ to 2 cups. Sprinkle salt and sugar.
                            Pressure cook for a whistle in medium flame.
                            Open once pressure is released naturally and add the powdered cumin and fenugreek (I had methi powder already)
                            Just give it a boil, garnish with coriander leaves and butter.
                            
                        </p>
                        <h3>Tips</h3>
                        <p align="left">Better cover the masala while it is frying as it splutters a lot.
                            You can add ginger garlic paste instead of adding whole garlic, ginger. If adding paste, add after sauteeing onion and fry for 30 seconds.
                            Instead of adding fenugreek seeds powder, you can add kasoori methi like in my video.
                            Roasted cumin seeds powder add a nice flavor to the gravy, so try not to skip it. I forgot to add in my updated video but highly recommend.
                            While sauteeing the masala, make sure to saute until oil oozes. Otherwise curry won't be tasty.</p>

                        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                        <p> <br>3 cup all purpose flour
                            <br>2 cup hung curd
                            <br>1/2 cup ghee
                            <br>3 cup sugar
                            <br>5 strand saffron
                            <br>1/2 teaspoon powdered green cardamom
                            <br>1/2 cup corn flour
                            <br>1 1/2 pinch baking soda
                            <br>2 cup sunflower oil
                            <br>3 cup water
                            <br>4 drops rose essence
                            <br>1/2 teaspoon edible food color
                        </p>
                        <h3>Instructions</h3>
                        <p align="left"> <br>Step 1: Prepare the Jalebi batter and let it ferment overnight
                            To make this easy Jalebi recipe, mix together all-purpose flour, cornflour and baking soda in a bowl. Now, add ghee and food colour to the above mixture and give a mix. To make a thick batter add hung curd and water. Mix well until it is thick but has a slightly flowing consistency. Keep it aside for 8-10 hours to ferment. This step is important to give that unique "khatta" taste to Jalebi. To make the sugar syrup, heat water in a pan over medium flame. Add sugar and mix until fully dissolved. Simmer the syrup until it attains one-string consistency. Add saffron, cardamom powder and rose essence. Stir well to prepare the final sugar syrup. This will be used to soak the jalebis and give them their signature sweetness.
                            <br>Step 2: Deep fry the Jalebis
                            Now, heat oil in a pan over medium flame for deep frying. Fill the jalebi batter in a muslin cloth and pierce a small hole in the cloth. You can even use a squeezy bottle (ketchup bottles with a small nozzle on top) to make jalebis. Now just squeeze the muslin cloth to make concentric circles. Move from inside to outside to make perfect circles. Fry till jalebis from both the sides until they are crispy in texture and golden in colour.
                            <br>Step 3: Soak the Jalebis in sugar syrup and serve
                            Soak the jalebis in sugar syrup for 3-4 minutes in warm sugar syrup. Ensure that the sugar syrup is warm and not very hot, as this will make the jalebis limp. Don't soak the jalebis for too long if you wish to retain their crispiness. Now, remove the jalebis from the syrup and place it on a tray lined with butter paper or foil. Decorate with silver foil (optional) and serve the jalebis hot, warm or at room temperature with creamy Rabri. Note: To make the jalebi even more delicious, add a little bit of ghee to the batter, this will give your jalebi that perfect aroma. To the crispy Jalebi, don't forget to ferment the batter overnight.

                            <br>Salt to taste
                        </p>
                        <h3>Instructions</h3>
                        <p align="left">
                            Wash rice and soak it in water for 15-20 minutes. Drain and keep aside until needed.
                            Heat ghee and oil together in a pressure cooker (2-liter capacity, stainless steel cooker) on low flame. Add bay leaf, cinnamon, clove, and sauté for 30 seconds. Add onion and sauté until it turns light brown or for approx. 2 minutes.
                            Add chopped tomato, green peas, french beans and carrot. Stir-fry them for approximately 2 minutes.
                            Add soaked (drained) rice, garam masala powder, turmeric powder, red chilli powder and salt.
                            Stir-fry them for approximately 2 minutes. Add 1 cup water and mix well.
                            Close the lid and cook over medium flame for 2 whistles. When 1st whistle is completed, reduce the flame to low and cook until another whistle. Turn off flame.
                            Let it cool at room temperature until pressure inside cooker comes down naturally. Open the lid carefully and fluff the rice with a fork. Transfer it to a serving bowl and garnish with fresh coriander leaves.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Tips</h3>
                        <p align="left">If you are using pressure cooker made of aluminum then cook it for 2 whistles on medium flame.
                            You can prepare it in large quantity in larger pressure cooker. Just use rice and water in 1:2 ratios. i.e. for every one cup rice two cups water should be added.
                            You can also prepare equally delicious mixed vegetable rice pulao in a pan with a lid. Use same amount of ingredients as mentioned in this recipe, cover pan with a lid and cook it on low flame for 8-10 minutes. Do not open the lid in between while cooking. After turning off the flame, open the lid after 7-8 minutes. However, cooking in a pan may require more water as steam will escape easily, hence add 1/4 cup more water for given recipe.
