                        In a wok (kadai), frying pan or skillet, dry roast the vermicelli stirring often on a low heat until golden and set aside. If you want then you can roast the vermicelli in ghee also.
                        In the same pan, heat ghee and add chopped dry fruits, dates, nuts and sauté for 3 to 4 minutes stirring often on a low heat.
                        
                        Heat milk in a heavy saucepan or pot or kadai (wok) on medium-low to medium heat. Let the milk come to a boil. Stir a few times while the milk heats and comes to a boil.
                        
                        Lower the heat and simmer for 8 to 10 minutes until the milk slightly thickens. Stir often while the milk reduces and thickens.
                        Add the roasted vermicelli and sugar to the milk. Mix well to combine.
                        Simmer on low to medium-low heat until vermicelli are cooked and have softened. This will take about 8 to 10 minutes on a low heat.
                        The milk will also thicken and reduce in volume.
                        Add the cardamom powder and saffron strands.
                        Also add the entire sauteed dry fruits, nuts and ghee mixture to the milk.
                        Switch off the heat and mix well.
                        Check the taste and add more sugar if required.
                        
                        Finally add rose water and give a stir.
                        Serve the sheer khurma hot, warm or chilled.
                        You can also garnish sheer khurma with saffron strands or rose petals or slivered nuts.
                        
                        Store any leftovers in a covered bowl or container in the fridge for a couple of days.
                        Sheer Khurma will thicken as it cools. So keep this is mind and cook it to your preferred consistency.

                    <h3>Tips</h3>
                    <p align="left">Vermicelli:  Use the thin, long and fine whole wheat vermicelli. These have long strands, so you need to break them before roasting.
                        Nuts & Dry Fruits: If you are allergic to some nuts, you can easily skip them. You can even add your favorite nuts and dried fruits. 
                        Dates: Use any good quality dates. If there are seeds in the dates, then chop them and discard the seeds. Dry dates (known as kharik) can also be added. If using dry dates, then soak them in water for a few hours until they soften. Chop and remove the seeds. Then add them when the vermicelli has softened.</p>
